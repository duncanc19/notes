# 11: Amazon S3 Introduction

- Advertised as infinitely scaling storage

### Use cases

- Backup and storage
- Disaster recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid cloud storage
- Application hosting
- Media hosting
- Data lakes and big data analytics
- Software delivery
- Static websites


### Buckets

- You can store objects (files) in buckets (directories)
- Must have globally unique name
- Defined at region level
- Naming convention - no uppercase or underscore, not an IP, must start with lower-case letter or number

### Objects

- An object has a key, which is the full path
- Made up of bucket, prefix and object name
- There's technically no concept of directories despite how they are shown in the UI, just keys with long names and slashes
- e.g. ```s3://my-bucket/folder1/folder2/my_file.txt```  
- When a file is larger than 5GB, you need to use multi-part upload


## Security

#### User-based
- IAM Policies - which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM

#### Resource-based
- Bucket policies - bucket-wide rules from S3 console (allows cross account)
- Object Access Control List - finer grain
- Bucket Access Control List - less common

An IAM principal can access an S3 object if the user IAM permissions ALLOW it OR the resource policy ALLOWS it, and there is no explicit DENY.


### Bucket policies
JSON-based policies
- Resources: buckets and objects
- Effect: Allow or Deny
- Actions: Set of API actions to allow/deny
- Principal: Account or user to apply policy to

Can be used to grant public access, force object encryption at upload and grant access to other accounts

### Bucket settings for Block Public Access
- Settings created to prevent company data leaks
- Leave setting on if bucket should never be made public
- Can be set at account level

## Static websites

You can host static websites on S3 and have them accessible on the internet

If you get a 403 Forbidden error, make sure the bucket policay allows public reads

There is a static website hosting section in the bucket Properties tab


## Versioning

- Can enable versioning at the bucket level
- When you overwrite a key, the version will change and the previous version will still be available
- Considered best practice - protects against unintended deletes, easy to roll back
- Files previously not versioned have version null
- Suspending versioning does not delete the previous versions
- Deleting files does not permanently delete them, adds a delete marker

## S3 Replication

Cross Region Replication and Same Region Replication

Use cases:
- CRR - compliance, lower latency access, replication across accounts
- SRR - log aggregation, live replication between prod and test accounts

- Must enable versioning
- Buckets can be in different AWS accounts
- Copying is asynchronous
- Must give IAM permissions to S3
- Only new objects are replicated when you enable, need to use S3 Batch Replication to replicate existing objects
- No chaining of replication
- Can replicate delete markers, deletions with version ID are not replicated


## S3 Storage Classes

Durability:
- How many times an object will be lost in S3
- 99.99999999999%

Availability:
- How readily available a service is
- Varies depending on storage class

### 6 storage classes:
#### S3 Standard - general purpose

- Standard has 99.99% availabilty - 53 mins a year
- Used for frequently accessed data
- Low latency and high throughput
- Use cases: big data analytics, mobile and gaming applications, content distribution


#### Infrequent Access

- Less frequently accessed but requires rapid access when needed
- Lower cost than Standard
- Infrequent Access Standard - 99.9% availability, use cases disaster recovery, backups
- One Zone - 99.5% availability, high durability, data lost when availablity zone is destroyed, use cases back-ups of on-premise data

#### Glacier
- Low-cost for archiving/backup
- Price for storage and object retrieval cost
- Instant Retrieval - millisecond retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
- Flexible Retrieval - Expedited (1 to 5 min), Standard (3 to 5 hours), Bulk (5 to 12 hours), minimum duration 90 days 
- Deep Archive - Standard (12 hours), Bulk (48 hours), minimum duration 180 days


#### S3 Intelligent Tiering

- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
- Moves objects automatically between access tiers based on usage
- No retrieval charges
- Frequent Access (default), Infrequent Access (not accessed for 30 days), Archive Instant access (not accessed for 90 days) are all automatic
- Archive and Deep Archive access tiers optional and configurable
